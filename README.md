# Secure Coding Review — Password Security Tool

## Overview
This repository contains the **Secure Coding Review Report** for the *Password Security Tool* project. 

The review focuses on identifying security risks in handling sensitive data (such as user passwords) and provides remediation steps aligned with secure coding best practices.  
For a practical demonstration of fixes, see the implementation in the main project repository:  
[Password Security Tool Repository](https://github.com/seetharamdamarla/password-security-tool)

## Report Contents
The review report covers:
- Executive Summary  
- Findings (issues and risks)  
- Concrete remediation plan and code patches  
- CI/CD integration recommendations  
- Testing recommendations  
- Tools and commands for static analysis and dependency checks  

The full report is available here:  
**[PasswordSecurityTool_Review.pdf](./PasswordSecurityTool_Review.pdf)**

## Key Findings
The review highlighted several security issues common in password-handling applications:
- Passwords printed to console or logs  
- Plaintext storage of sensitive data  
- Weak or incorrect use of hashing algorithms  
- Hard-coded secrets or credentials in source code  
- Insecure dependency versions and supply-chain risks  
- Unhandled exceptions leaking stack traces  
- Unsafe subprocess or shell usage with user input  

---

## Recommendations
- Replace `input()` with `getpass.getpass()` for secure password entry  
- Use Argon2 (`argon2-cffi`) for password hashing instead of MD5/SHA256  
- Avoid plaintext storage of sensitive data  
- Remove hardcoded secrets and use environment variables  
- Run dependency scans using `pip-audit` or `safety`  
- Add static analysis tools such as `bandit`  
- Integrate CI/CD workflows for automated security checks

## Deliverables
- **Report (this repository):** `PasswordSecurityTool_Review.pdf` (detailed analysis, findings, remediation steps)  
- **Implementation (separate repository):** [password-security-tool](https://github.com/seetharamdamarla/password-security-tool) — includes `password_tool.py` with secure coding practices
